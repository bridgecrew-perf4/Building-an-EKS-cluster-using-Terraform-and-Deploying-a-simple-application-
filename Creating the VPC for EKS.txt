Creating the VPC for EKS cluster:
Amazon EKS requires subnets in at least two Availability Zones. AWS recommend a VPC with public and private subnets so that Kubernetes can create public load balancers in the public subnets that load balance traffic to pods running on nodes that are in private subnets.
We will be deploying the VPC using CloudFormation,hence please use the below S3 Template URL to deploy the VPC which will provision 2 public and 2 private subnets in two different AZ's.
